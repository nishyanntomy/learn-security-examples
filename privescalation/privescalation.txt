Privilege escalation vulnerability occurs when a user gains higher access privileges than intended. 
This could happen due to inadequate access controls or insecure configurations, allowing malicious 
actors to exploit vulnerabilities and elevate their privileges within the system.

Secure Version Prevention:
Implementing proper access controls and least privilege principles can prevent privilege escalation 
vulnerabilities. By ensuring that users only have access to the resources and functionalities they are 
authorized to use, the likelihood of unauthorized privilege escalation is minimized. Additionally, 
regularly updating and patching software to fix known vulnerabilities can also help prevent exploitation.

Additional Security Mechanisms:
To further prevent privilege escalation attacks, additional security mechanisms such as role-based 
access control (RBAC), privilege separation, and principle of least privilege can be incorporated. 
RBAC allows administrators to assign specific roles to users, limiting their access based on their 
responsibilities. Privilege separation involves splitting processes into smaller components with 
distinct privileges, reducing the potential impact of a compromised component. Principle of least 
privilege dictates that users should only have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks, 
reducing the attack surface and limiting the potential damage of a successful attack. Regular security 
audits and monitoring can also help detect and respond to any unauthorized privilege escalation attempts promptly.
