Tampering involves unauthorized alteration or modification of data, code, or communication. 
For instance, an attacker might intercept and modify data packets in transit to change their contents. 
This vulnerability undermines data integrity and system trustworthiness, as it allows attackers to 
manipulate information, leading to erroneous decisions or actions. Implementing secure communication 
protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or digital signatures, can prevent tampering by 
encrypting data and verifying its authenticity throughout transmission. These measures ensure that data 
remains unchanged and unaltered by unauthorized parties. Tampering primarily violates the Integrity aspect 
of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad, as it compromises the accuracy and reliability of data.
