- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?


Repudiation vulnerability occurs when a user denies performing a specific action or transaction, 
leading to disputes or legal issues. Insecure systems may lack proper logging and auditing mechanisms, 
making it difficult to trace and prove user actions accurately, thus enabling users to repudiate their actions.

Secure Version Prevention:
The secure version of the system incorporates robust logging and auditing mechanisms, ensuring that 
all user actions are logged and attributed to the respective users. By maintaining comprehensive logs 
of user activities, the system can provide irrefutable evidence of user actions, preventing users from 
repudiating their actions easily.

Additional Security Mechanisms:
To enhance prevention against repudiation attacks, additional security mechanisms such as digital 
signatures, transaction receipts, and blockchain technology can be incorporated. Digital signatures can 
be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of transactions, making it harder for users to deny their 
involvement. Transaction receipts provide users with evidence of their actions, reducing the likelihood of 
repudiation. Blockchain technology offers immutable and transparent transaction records, making it practically 
impossible for users to repudiate their actions once recorded on the blockchain. Additionally, implementing 
multi-factor authentication (MFA) and enforcing strong password policies can help ensure that user identities 
are accurately verified, further reducing the risk of repudiation. Regular security audits and monitoring 
can also help detect and respond to any repudiation attempts promptly.
