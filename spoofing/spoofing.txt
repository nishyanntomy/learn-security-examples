Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Spoofing involves falsifying one's identity or information to gain unauthorized access to a 
system or data. For example, email spoofing involves forging the sender's email address to deceive 
the recipient into believing the message is from a trusted source. This vulnerability undermines 
system integrity and confidentiality as it enables unauthorized individuals to impersonate 
legitimate users or entities. Implementing secure authentication mechanisms, such as two-factor 
authentication or digital signatures, can prevent spoofing by verifying the identity of users or data sources. 
These measures bolster system security by ensuring that only authenticated entities can access 
sensitive information or resources. Spoofing primarily violates the Confidentiality and Integrity aspects 
of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad, as it can lead to unauthorized access 
and tampering with data.
