Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?


Information disclosure occurs when sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized parties. This can happen 
due to inadequate security measures such as improper error handling or insecure configurations. 
For instance, exposing sensitive cookies without SSL encryption or constructing SQL queries 
without proper sanitization can lead to information disclosure.

Secure Version Prevention:
Implementing secure practices like enforcing SSL encryption for data transmission and using parameterized 
queries to prevent SQL injection can mitigate information disclosure vulnerabilities. By ensuring that 
sensitive data is transmitted and handled securely, the likelihood of unauthorized access or exposure is 
reduced significantly.

CIA Property Violation:
Tampering violates the integrity aspect of the CIA triad. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and 
unaltered. Tampering compromises data integrity by unauthorized modifications, leading to potential 
data corruption or unauthorized access. Secure coding practices and mechanisms help uphold data integrity 
and prevent tampering.

Additional Security Mechanisms:
To enhance security, additional measures such as input validation, access control, and security headers 
can be incorporated. Input validation and sanitization help prevent various vulnerabilities, while access 
control ensures that users only access authorized resources. Security headers like CSP and HSTS provide 
additional layers of protection against common web-based attacks. Regular security audits and penetration 
testing further bolster the application's security posture by identifying and addressing 
vulnerabilities proactively.
