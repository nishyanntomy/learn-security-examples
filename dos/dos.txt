- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

A DoS vulnerability occurs when attackers flood a system with excessive requests, overwhelming 
its resources and causing it to become unresponsive. This disrupts the availability of the system 
for legitimate users, potentially leading to downtime and service degradation.

Prevention by Secure Version:
The secure version prevents DoS vulnerabilities by implementing measures like rate limiting, 
load balancing, and robust error handling. These techniques help distribute incoming traffic evenly, 
handle spikes in requests gracefully, and prevent system overload, thereby maintaining availability.

Additional Security Mechanisms:
To further prevent DoS attacks, additional measures include deploying DDoS protection services, 
implementing Web Application Firewalls (WAF), using Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), 
ensuring scalable infrastructure, and conducting regular security assessments. These mechanisms 
collectively enhance the system's resilience against DoS attacks by detecting, mitigating, and adapting 
to evolving threats efficiently.
